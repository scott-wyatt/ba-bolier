Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the admin members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion with the devs.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.

Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't match the project's coding conventions (see `doc/coding.txt`) or are controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/scott-wyatt/ba-bolier/tags) are created regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of the boliler.
